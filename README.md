# HumanizerRepro

Quick reproduction of an issue I'm running into where xbuild doesn't create the various language folders in the bin folder or in the final binary. MSBuild has these in the bin/ directory and humanizer is properly changing languages on the device.

In order to see the humanized date, change your device language to spanish. I've only included the humanizer spanish assembly in this project.
